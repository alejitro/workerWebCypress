# first, install Cypress, then run all tests (in parallel)
stages:
  - build
  - test



# cache using branch name
# https://gitlab.com/help/ci/caching/index.md
cache:
  key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
  paths:
    - node_modules
    - cache/Cypress


# this job installs NPM dependencies and Cypress
install:
  image: cypress/base:10
  stage: build

  script:
    - npm ci
    # show where the Cypress test runner binaries are cached
    - $(npm bin)/cypress cache path
    # show all installed versions of Cypress binary
    - $(npm bin)/cypress cache list
    - $(npm bin)/cypress verify

# two jobs that run after "install" job finishes
# NPM dependencies and Cypress binary should be already installed
